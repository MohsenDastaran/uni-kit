[![Build Status](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/gpui-kit/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/gpui-kit/) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gpui-kit.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gpui-kit)

Copy-paste native UI for Rust desktop toolkits. The same component catalog is hand-written for each framework and published on <https://gpui-kit.com>. You copy the source into your own app, or install it with [`uni-kit`](registry). The CLI does not generate components. It copies the files listed in [`registry/components.json`](registry/components.json).

GPUI and Slint are in the catalog now. egui, QuickGUI, and other toolkits join the same pages after their components are written. The work is tracked in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Frameworks

| Framework | How an app uses it | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) | Depend on the `gpui-kit` crate. Copy a sample from the component page. | On the site |
| [Slint](https://slint.dev) | `npx uni-kit add slint <component>` copies the `.slint` files into `ui/components/`. | On the site |
| egui, QuickGUI, and others | The same pages, once the source exists. | [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) |

The site docs stay one site, in English. A framework selector on each component page switches the live example and the copyable source. GPUI samples assume an app that depends on `gpui-kit` (that crate already brings `gpui-component` and `gpui-base`). Slint samples are the files under `crates/slint-component/ui/`.

```bash
npx uni-kit add slint alert-dialog
bunx uni-kit add slint alert-dialog
pnpm dlx uni-kit add slint alert-dialog
```

The same command takes `egui`, `gpui`, or `quickgui` once that toolkit's files are in the manifest. Slint writes `ui/components/`. The Rust toolkits write `src/components/` and can add a `pub mod` line. `--dir` overrides the directory.

Blocks (Login, Dashboard, Settings) and starter templates are next. See the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## GPUI

`gpui-kit` is the crate a GPUI application depends on. It pins the matching GPUI release and re-exports GPUI, `gpui-base`, `gpui-component`, and the default assets.

```text
gpui-kit             The one crate applications depend on
├── gpui-base        Unstyled behavior, state, and infrastructure
└── gpui-component   The styled component library
```

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui-kit = "0.6"
```

`gpui_kit::init` runs before any component is used, and the first view in a window is a `Root`. The component pages on the site are the samples to copy. Architecture of the GPUI crates is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The default `assets` feature bundles the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icon set. Pass it in with `gpui_kit::application().with_assets(gpui_kit::assets::Assets)`.

JavaScript extension hosts add `gpui-shell` separately. `gpui-component-shell` supplies the styled catalog for that host.

## Slint

Slint components are source you copy, not a crate from this repository. `crates/slint-component` is the gallery used by the website. An application does not depend on it.

From `crates/slint-component/ui/`, copy `theme.slint`, the component, the files it imports, and the `icons/` folder beside `icon.slint`. These files are written for Slint 1.17.

```bash
cargo add slint@1.17
cargo add --build slint-build@1.17
```

`build.rs` compiles the app window:

```rust
fn main() {
    slint_build::compile("ui/app.slint").unwrap();
}
```

`AlertDialog` fills its parent, so place it on the window. `destructive: true` uses the danger confirm button. The dialog sets `open` to false when either button is pressed.

```slint
import { Theme } from "theme.slint";
import { Button } from "button.slint";
import { AlertDialog } from "alert-dialog.slint";

export component App inherits Window {
    in-out property <bool> ask-delete;

    background: Theme.background;

    VerticalLayout {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        alignment: center;
        Button {
            text: "Delete project";
            clicked => { root.ask-delete = true; }
        }
    }

    AlertDialog {
        open <=> root.ask-delete;
        title: "Delete project?";
        description: "This cannot be undone.";
        confirm-text: "Delete";
        destructive: true;
    }
}
```

## Roadmap

The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) is the plan for this catalog. Current progress:

1. Folder layout
2. GPUI catalog you can copy from the site
3. Design tokens
4. Framework selector
5. Slint components, one per GPUI component
6. Blocks — Login, Dashboard, Settings
7. Starter templates
8. Deploy and launch

egui, QuickGUI, and other toolkits are added after that, one at a time, once the API is stable: the full catalog and the three blocks, hand-written, then a value in the same selector.

## Skills for AI coding agents

| `gpui-kit-design-guides` | Layout, spacing, hierarchy, interaction states, overlays, and interface copy. |

## Development

```bash
# GPUI component gallery
cargo run

# Website
make dev:website

# Website, rebuilding the Slint gallery first
make dev:website-slint
```

`make dev` is the recommended one for Slint work: it rebuilds the gallery wasm
and then starts the site, so a refresh shows the change. It is the same as
`make dev:website-slint`.

```bash
make dev
```

With no `SLUGS`, `make dev` rebuilds only the pages whose sources changed since
they were last built, and skips the wasm build entirely when nothing did. Name
pages to force a rebuild:

```bash
make dev SLUGS=dock
make dev SLUGS=dock,dropdown_button
```

Each page is a separate component type, so the whole catalog is one generated
Rust file that holds every example. A single `rustc` compiling all of it needs
more than 9 GiB and does not fit on a 14 GiB laptop alongside a desktop session.
The build is therefore split per page: each page is its own wasm in
`crates/slint-component/www/dist/pages/<slug>/`, and the site loads the folder
for the page it is showing. One page is a few MB and finishes in seconds.

Build every page this way — bounded, one at a time — with:

```bash
make build:wasm-slint-pages
```

The first `make dev` on a fresh clone has no stamps yet, so it builds every page
once; that takes a few minutes and is the price of never needing the single
oversized compile. After that only the pages you touch are rebuilt.

`make build:wasm-slint` still produces the combined module. It needs more memory
than a laptop can spare, so it expects a bigger machine.

Every build runs in a memory cgroup sized from the machine: total RAM minus a
5 GiB reserve for the desktop. The build is the first thing to die rather than
the session. Override the cap with `GUARD_MEMORY_MAX` (a systemd size):

```bash
GUARD_MEMORY_MAX=6G make dev SLUGS=dock
```

When the cap fires, the build stops with a message naming the limit and the
machine's memory, instead of the bare exit code it used to leave behind.

A soft `GUARD_MEMORY_HIGH` ceiling defaults to that same value on purpose. Set
below it, the kernel reclaims continuously and the build stalls at a fraction of
one CPU: a 6G high / 9G max pair made one wasm build take 36 minutes at 37% CPU,
without ever reaching the hard cap.

`crates/slint-component/scripts/guard.sh` is that wrapper; run any heavy command
through it. It falls back to `ulimit -v` where `systemd-run` is unavailable.

Larger GPUI examples run as their own packages: `cargo run -p example-dock`, `example-editor`, `example-markdown`, `system_monitor`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
